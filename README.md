# Learnings
Learning Repository: Math, Finance, and Python
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my learnings and resources in three core areas: Mathematics, Finance, and Python Programming. Each folder contains notes, code examples, and relevant materials that I’m actively working through as part of my self-study to transition into Quantitative Finance and High-Frequency Trading.

Math:
A repository of mathematical concepts and techniques essential for Quantitative Finance, including calculus, linear algebra, probability, stochastic calculus, and more.

Finance:
Notes on core finance concepts, focusing on financial instruments, pricing models, options, derivatives, portfolio management, and quantitative finance strategies.

Coding:
Python programming materials, including scripts, tutorials, projects and notes. The focus is on Python for data analysis, algorithmic trading, Monte Carlo simulations, and other finance-related applications.

This repository is a work in progress and is updated as I learn and apply new concepts. It’s a personal knowledge base designed to consolidate resources, track progress, and document the process of acquiring skills for a career in Quantitative Finance.

Feel free to explore and contribute to my learning journey!
